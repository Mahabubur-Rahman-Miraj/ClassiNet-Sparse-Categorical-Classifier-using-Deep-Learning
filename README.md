# ClassiNet-Sparse-Categorical-Classifier-using-Deep-Learning
ClassiNet is a deep learning project designed to classify data into multiple categories using a feed-forward neural network. It leverages TensorFlow/Keras with Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy as the loss function. The model is trained on labeled data and optimized using the Adam optimizer for accurate predictions.
